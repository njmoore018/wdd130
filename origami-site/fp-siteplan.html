    <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Do you ever find yourself with some small amount of free time and nothing
        to do with it? What do you normally do, look at your phone? That's not
        very beneficial for you. What if you could create something cool and
        unique in that time instead? You could stand out from all the people who
        sit and stare at their phones all the time, and all you need is a few
        pieces of paper. My plan is to create a website to share simple origami
        designs and tutorials that anyone can follow and recreate. You could
        amaze your friends simply by folding paper, and you would certainly feel
        better than if you sat around and did nothing. Even in the worst-case
        scenario where nobody is impressed by the work of art you've created; you
        can at least enjoy your own creation and sense of satisfaction from
        learning a new skill.
