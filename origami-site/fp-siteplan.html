        <h1>Site Plan - Origami Site</h1>
        <h2>By: Nathan Moore</h2>

    <h3>Contents:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Site Name</li>
        <li>Site Purpose</li>
        <li>Target Audience</li>

    <h3>Site Name:</h3>
    <p>Into the Fold</p>
    <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Do you ever find yourself with some small amount of free time and nothing
        to do with it? What do you normally do, look at your phone? That's not
        very beneficial for you. What if you could create something cool and
        unique in that time instead? You could stand out from all the people who
        sit and stare at their phones all the time, and all you need is a few
        pieces of paper. My plan is to create a website to share simple origami
        designs and tutorials that anyone can follow and recreate. You could
        amaze your friends simply by folding paper, and you would certainly feel
        better than if you sat around and did nothing. Even in the worst-case
        scenario where nobody is impressed by the work of art you've created; you
        can at least enjoy your own creation and sense of satisfaction from
        learning a new skill.

    <h3>Site Map</h3>
    <div class="site-map">
        <h4 class="home">Home Page</h4>
            <p>
                The home page will contain an introduction to the website, as
                well as links to the two sub pages. There will be a small menu
                to contain these links within the header of each page, and a
                footer to contain links to social media pages. The home page will
                also contain pictures of some popular origami designs and some
                words to excite visitors (maybe including a call to action on one
                of the images).
            </p>
        <h4 class="tutorials">Tutorial Videos</h4>
            <p>
                The tutorials page will contain origami creations each with the
                name, a photo, and a tutorial video for how to make it yourself.
                This page can be updated frequently with new and more exciting
                creations as submissions come in and new folding methods are
                learned. These videos will be homemade by myself and likely
                uploaded to YouTube with a link to the video on included on the
                page.
            </p>
        <h4 class="submissions">User Submissions</h4>
            <p>
                The submissions page will contain submissions from visitors to
                the site. There will be a method for submitting photos at the
                bottom of this page (likely an email address). I'd also like to
                include a method for visitors to "like" or "upvote" certain
                submissions, but that may be outside my capabilities at the
                moment.
