    <h2>Iron Man Quote:</h2>
    "Is it better to be <strong>feared</strong> or <em>respected</em>?" - I say, is it too much to ask 
    for both? With that in mind I humbly present you the crown jewel of Stark 
    Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate the 
    latest in proprietary Repulsor Technology. They say that the best weapon is 
    the one that you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree! I prefer... 
    the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it, that's how 
    America does it... and it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to 
    let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys 
    won't even want to come out of their caves. [one of the missiles launches and 
    heads for the mountains in the distance] For your consideration... the Jericho.
